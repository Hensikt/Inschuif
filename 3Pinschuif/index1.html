      <h1>Space Trade</h1>
      <p>Space trade is interplanetary or interstellar trade.<br>
        Plans and ideas on how trade functions have been published by Futurists and pundits since the 1960s,
        though science fiction writers have been envisioning such trade for several more decades.</p>

      <h2>Reality</h2>
      <p>Though the existence of interstellar trade is unknown,
        there are several theories developed by well known economists on how trade calculations and interest rates would have to be adjusted in such a circumstance.<br>
        At very high velocities,
        for example a space station traveling at significant speeds relative to the speed of light,
        there will be time dilation.<br>
        In 2004 Espen Gaarder Haug published a technical research article in Wilmott Magazine on how interest rates and securities calculations had to be adjusted for very high velocities to avoid arbitrage.<br>
        He published similar theories on what he called "SpaceTime Finance" in a book published in 2007 titled Derivatives Models on Models.<br>
        Paul Krugman, winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences,
        published a research article on interstellar trade in 2010.</p>
